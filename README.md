# ✅ PROJECT-15

In the given scenario, the primary goal was to conduct a comprehensive analysis comparing the average product sales for a specific promotional period in 2023 to the sales forecast for the entire year of 2024. The data crucial for this analysis was initially identified to be stored in .csv files on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), indicating a cloud-based data storage solution. To kickstart the analysis, the decision was made to perform the necessary tasks, including data extraction, separation, and transformation, directly at the source. The source, in this case, was the Google Cloud Platform, where the data resided. Leveraging the capabilities of Google's BigQuery environment, the analysis involved utilizing SQL (Structured Query Language) due to its effectiveness in handling large datasets and its seamless integration with BigQuery. The decision to use SQL in the BigQuery environment was driven by its notable processing power, making it well-suited for handling substantial volumes of data efficiently. This choice was made in comparison to PowerQuery, indicating a preference for BigQuery's processing capabilities over PowerQuery, which might be attributed to the specific requirements and characteristics of the dataset involved in this analysis.

By directly conducting the analysis at the source using BigQuery and SQL, the process likely gained efficiency and speed. The use of cloud-based solutions like Google Cloud Platform allows for scalability, making it possible to handle large datasets and complex analyses. Additionally, leveraging SQL in the BigQuery environment implies a familiarity with database querying, suggesting that the team involved in this analysis possessed the necessary skills to work with structured data and extract meaningful insights. Overall, this approach reflects a data-driven methodology, where the choice of tools and platforms aligns with the specific requirements of the analysis. The utilization of Google Cloud Platform and BigQuery, along with the preference for SQL over alternative query languages, suggests a strategic and informed decision-making process in conducting a thorough evaluation of product sales during the specified promotional period and forecasting for the upcoming year.

# ✅ PROCESS

Due to some inherent limitations, part of the dataset was not completed, which made its use unfeasible when developing the report. Instead of reporting the problem to superiors and stopping the project, the team chose to find an alternative solution to work around the situation. Given that we could not use all the information in the dataset, we decided to work with the concept of sample and population. Thus, a representative sample of the data was extracted and then a Python script was developed to calculate statistical measures and estimate the confidence interval for the population's average sales. The idea behind this was to use the c.i. to provide an estimate of the range of values that likely contain the true population average sales, allowing for much more informed decision making.

The Python script was responsible for developing statistical models to calculate the moving average, moving standard deviation, confidence level, upper and lower limits, as well as identifying outliers. In addition, hypothesis tests, correlation tables and linear regression analyzes were carried out to increase the precision of the final result. Subsequently, the DAX language was used to create measures based on the outlier information. This made it possible to identify which indicators were contributing to the occurrence of values that exceeded the established limits. These measures were presented on visual cards, displaying information such as customer code, customer description, sku code, sku subcode, sku description, and week in which the outlier occurred.

# ✅ CONCLUSION

The culmination of the outlined process resulted in the creation of a sophisticated and interactive Business Intelligence (BI) report. This report goes beyond a mere presentation of sales data, offering a nuanced analysis that incorporates 2024 sales overlaid with the corresponding figures from 2023. The inclusion of a 95% confidence interval provides decision-makers with a statistical range, emphasizing the reliability and precision of the presented information.

One notable achievement of the analysis is the identification of outliers within the dataset. These outliers represent data points that deviate significantly from the expected patterns or trends. The ability to pinpoint outliers equips decision-makers with a powerful tool for more accurate and informed actions. By recognizing and understanding the factors contributing to these outliers, organizations can proactively address issues, capitalize on opportunities, and make strategic decisions based on a more nuanced understanding of the data. The role of a Business Analyst, as underscored in this context, extends beyond simply answering predefined questions. It involves a proactive approach to exploring data, identifying patterns, and addressing potential challenges. The acknowledgment that a Business Analyst should be prepared to tackle not only asked questions but also those that were not explicitly posed speaks to the analytical agility and foresight required in this role.

Furthermore, the emphasis on finding alternative solutions when faced with challenges underscores the adaptability and problem-solving skills inherent in successful business analysis. In the described scenario, when confronted with incomplete data, the team did not succumb to obstacles but instead devised a solution involving statistical sampling, Python scripting, and the utilization of the DAX language to create measures. This innovative approach not only enabled the project to proceed but also added depth and accuracy to the final Business Intelligence report. In essence, the work of a Business Analyst involves navigating complex datasets, extracting meaningful insights, and presenting them in a format that empowers decision-makers. The culmination of these efforts, as evidenced in the refined BI report, provides a valuable tool for strategic planning, informed decision-making, and a deeper understanding of the factors influencing sales trends within the organization.
