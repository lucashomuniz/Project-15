# ✅ PROJECT-15

In this project, the primary objective is to compare **average product sales** during the **2023 exclusive promotional period** with the **2024 sales forecast**. Utilizing advanced technologies, we will leverage **Google BigQuery** as a **serverless data warehouse**, employing **SQL queries** for efficient large-scale data processing and analysis. The **Google Cloud Platform** will serve as the integrated infrastructure, facilitating seamless data integration and analytics. **Python** will be utilized for data manipulation and scripting, enhancing our analytical capabilities. Additionally, the project will implement **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to extract deeper data insights. This comprehensive approach ensures a robust analysis of **sales performance**, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and develop future **business strategies**.

# ✅ PROCESS

In this project, the **data** essential for the analysis was stored in **.csv files** on the **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, indicating a **cloud-based data storage** solution. To initiate the analysis, tasks such as **data extraction**, **separation**, and **transformation** were performed directly at the **source** using **Google BigQuery**. Leveraging **BigQuery's SQL** capabilities, we efficiently processed large datasets, benefiting from its superior **processing power** compared to **PowerQuery**, aligning with the dataset's specific requirements.

By conducting the analysis directly on the **GCP** using **BigQuery** and **SQL**, we enhanced **efficiency** and **speed**. The **cloud-based infrastructure** provided **scalability** for handling large datasets and complex analyses. Utilizing **SQL** within the **BigQuery environment** demonstrated the team's proficiency in **database querying**, enabling the extraction of **meaningful insights**. This **data-driven methodology**, with strategic tool selection, facilitated a comprehensive evaluation of **product sales** during the promotional period and **forecasting** for the upcoming year.

Due to **inherent limitations**, part of the dataset was incomplete, rendering it unusable for report development. Instead of halting the project, the team devised an alternative solution by employing **sampling** techniques. A **representative sample** was extracted, and a **Python script** was developed to calculate **statistical measures** and estimate the **confidence interval** for the population's **average sales**. This approach provided an **estimated range** for the true **population average sales**, enabling more informed decision-making.

The **Python script** developed **statistical models** to calculate the **moving average**, **moving standard deviation**, **confidence level**, **upper and lower limits**, and to identify **outliers**. Additionally, **hypothesis tests**, **correlation tables**, and **linear regression analyses** were conducted to enhance the **precision** of the results. Subsequently, the **DAX** language was utilized to create **measures** based on the **outlier data**, identifying contributing **indicators**. These measures were presented on **visual cards**, displaying information such as **customer code**, **SKU code**, **SKU description**, and the **week** in which the outlier occurred. The **DAX** language was also employed to develop the **product percentage difference** between the weeks of **2024 and 2023**, indicating **increases or decreases**.

# ✅ CONCLUSION

The process culminated in the development of an advanced and interactive **Business Intelligence (BI) report**. This report transcends basic sales data presentation by providing a comprehensive **analysis** that integrates **2024 sales** with **2023 figures**. The incorporation of a **95% confidence interval** offers decision-makers a statistical range, highlighting the **reliability** and **precision** of the data.

A significant outcome of the analysis was the **identification of outliers** within the dataset. These outliers are data points that significantly deviate from expected **patterns** or **trends**. Identifying outliers equips decision-makers with critical tools for more accurate and informed actions. Understanding the underlying factors of these outliers enables organizations to proactively address issues, leverage opportunities, and make strategic decisions based on a deeper data comprehension. The role of a **Business Analyst** in this context extends beyond answering predefined questions to proactively exploring data, identifying patterns, and addressing potential challenges. This underscores the need for **analytical agility** and **foresight** in the role.

Moreover, the focus on developing alternative solutions in the face of challenges highlights the **adaptability** and **problem-solving** skills essential for successful business analysis. In scenarios with **incomplete data**, the team implemented **statistical sampling**, **Python scripting**, and **DAX language** to create necessary **measures**. This innovative approach not only allowed the project to continue but also enhanced the **depth** and **accuracy** of the final BI report. Essentially, the Business Analyst's role involves navigating **complex datasets**, extracting **meaningful insights**, and presenting them in a manner that empowers decision-makers. The final BI report serves as a valuable tool for **strategic planning**, **informed decision-making**, and a deeper understanding of the **factors influencing sales trends** within the organization.
